We live in a digital age, one dangerous byproduct of which is declining mental health. Combining physical exercise with connecting with the real physical world, like nature, can improve mental well-being. So, I would like to expand on this ideology to create an Augmented-Reality-Based Trail Creator.

It is going to be a mobile app that creates personalized trails in users' environments. By overlaying virtual checkpoints, achievements, and rewards, it creates interactive elements that gamify this whole experience. It will take into account the user's fitness level to customize the difficulty of the trail and can adapt the route based on the user's pace and stamina. Users can also add their own personal goals and challenges. 

The goal is to make physical activity more fun and engaging so that it positively influences your mental well-being. It aims to use technology to reconnect with the real world, just as we have become connected to the digital world.
